# Snake
*_this version of snake was made for my educational training purposes_

*_there is a bug when you fill the whole grid with your snake and win_

# How to play
Use the arrow keys to move the head of the snake to eat (collide with) the fruit.
Each time the snake eats a fruit the snake gets longer and the tick speed of the game becomes 19/20 the original tick speed
There are four modes for walls selected randomly each game
1. No walls. In this mode, you will not see a brick pattern around the edge of the grid, so if you go to the edge of the map vertically *or* horizontally you will warp to the other side(left to right and vice versa and up to down and vice versa)
2. Horizontal walls. In this mode you will see two lines of brick patterns placed horizontally at the top and botto of the grid, so you can only warp horizontally
3. Vertical Walls. In this mode you will see two vertical lines of brick patterns placed on the left and right of the grid, so you can only warp vertically
4. All walls. In this mode you will see brick patterns on all of the edges of the map, so you cannot warp


Have fun :-)
